Tutorial (WIP)

Expected to take 1h
Background: CS / Robotics Developer, no formal methods / MC Background required

Prerequisite: Docker container

1. Model introduction

- picture of environment
- system architecture: showing which files are there, which nodes do what, ...

2. Running model

- explain how to translate, run it -> introduction to tooling architecture and tooling functionalities
- We provide an initial (working) property that verifies the 1st part of the task works correctly (i.e. the robot picks and places )
- Monitor the system execution traces in plot juggler

3. New property

- We provide an additional (not working) property that verifies the complete task (i.e. that the object is eventually located at its target location)
- Monitor the system execution traces in plot juggler (again)
