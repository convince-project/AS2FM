(ROS) SCXML Model Implementation
---------------------------------

SCXML is the language of choice to model the autonomous systems that we will be processed by AS2FM.

In order to make it more appealing to robotics developers, we have extended the default SCXML language with some ROS and BT specific features.

The following sections will guide you through the process of :ref:`creating a SCXML model of a ROS node <ros_node_scxml>` and of a :ref:`BT plugin <bt_plugin_scxml>` that can be processed by AS2FM.
